# üé¨ AI Movie Review Rating Predictor  

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20App-Visit%20Now-brightgreen?logo=streamlit)](https://509-final-project.streamlit.app/)  
Predict IMDb-style movie ratings (1‚Äì10‚≠ê) from written reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Ensemble Machine Learning models.  

---

## Overview  

This project analyzes thousands of real movie reviews from **The Movie Database (TMDb)** and predicts a numerical movie rating from 1 to 10 based solely on the written text.  

It uses **two powerful text-based models** (word-level and character-level regressors) and combines them into an **ensemble predictor** to capture both vocabulary semantics and emotional tone. SVR trained with cross validation and and XGBoost regressor are also available. 

You can try it live here üëâ **[509-Final-Project Streamlit App](https://509-final-project.streamlit.app/)**

## üß† Model Architecture  

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Word-level Model** | Uses TF-IDF features to capture word importance and context. |
| **Character-level Model** | Focuses on subword patterns, spelling, and punctuation sentiment. |
| **Ensemble** | Averages both models‚Äô predictions for smoother, more robust ratings. |
| **SVR CV** | A Support Vector Regressor trained with standard cross-validation using a word-level feature set. |
| **XGBoost Regressor** | Powerful gradient boosting model using word-level TF-IDF features for capturing nonlinear signals in review text.                   |
| **Selector** | Choose from various models to see which provides the best rating based on the review |

The model outputs a **continuous score** between 1 and 10, then rounds to the nearest whole rating.

## Example Predictions  

| Review | Predicted Rating |
|--------|------------------|
| ‚ÄúThis was the worst movie I've ever seen. Terrible acting.‚Äù | ‚≠ê 4 / 10 |
| ‚ÄúAbsolutely amazing! The visuals and story kept me hooked.‚Äù | ‚≠ê 9 / 10 |
| ‚ÄúIt was okay, not great but not terrible either.‚Äù | ‚≠ê 3 / 10 |
| ‚ÄúMasterpiece. Brilliant acting, stunning direction.‚Äù | ‚≠ê 8 / 10 |

These results show the model successfully distinguishing between **negative, neutral, and positive sentiment** ‚Äî mapping tone to numerical scores realistically.

## Run Locally (Flask Version)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gerardcf1/509-Prediction-Review-Final_Project.git
cd 509-Prediction-Review-Final_Project
```

2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3Ô∏è. Run the Flask App:
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

üåê Run via Streamlit (Recommended)
1. Launch Locally
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
2Ô∏è. Or Try It Online
```bash
https://509-final-project.streamlit.app/
```
How It Works...

The user selects a movie and writes a short review.

The app cleans and vectorizes the text (TF-IDF / char-ngrams).

Both models predict a numeric rating.

Their results are averaged ‚Üí clipped to a 1-10 range ‚Üí displayed with stars. The user can select alternate models from the drop down to see various results.
